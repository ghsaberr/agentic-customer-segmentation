# Agentic Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing

An end-to-end **AI-driven customer segmentation** system that groups insurance policyholders for targeted marketing and personalized service and an AI agent that interprets clusters, retrieves supporting documents/campaign assets, and recommends tailored actions and message drafts. 

Built with **FastAPI**, **MLflow**, and **Docker** — ready for deployment and monitoring.

---

## Features

- Automated **clustering pipeline** (KMeans + GMM + UMAP + PCA)
- **MLflow tracking** for metrics and artifacts  
- **FAISS vector index** for semantic document retrieval
- **Agentic insights** generated by an LLM (e.g., Llama 3)
- **Dockerized deployment** (FastAPI + MLflow)
- **Streamlit/Dash dashboard** for KPI monitoring

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- (Optional) Virtual environment for local development

---

## Deployment (via Docker Compose)

### Build and run all services

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:

- **segmentation_api** → FastAPI app on http://localhost:8000

- **mlflow** → MLflow tracking UI on http://localhost:5000

Both services share a Docker network (segmentation_net) to allow internal communication at http://mlflow:5000.


## Local
### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
.venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run API locally

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
